Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a company that is trying to expand their an online game called "Draw It or Lose It", across multiple platforms. 
They have requested that their software solution be one that is sacable and reusable across Windows, macOS, Linux, and potentially
mobile platforms. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

One thing I did particularly well was structuring the design document to clearly outline system architecture, platform considerations,
and user interaction flows. I ensured that each section—from requirements to class diagrams—was logically organized and easy to follow,
which helped stakeholders understand the technical direction.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document helped me clarify the scope before writing any code, Break down complex features into manageable components.
Visualize system behavior using UML diagrams and pseudocode. Identify dependencies and risks early, which streamlined development.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part, I’d improve the user interface mockups. They were functional but lacked polish and didn’t fully reflect the user experience.
I’d use tools like Figma or Adobe XD to create more interactive, high-fidelity prototypes that better communicate design intent.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I analyzed Gaming Room's existing game structure, and identified pain points in scalability and platform support. Considering
the user's needs when designing software is crucial to ensuring the development team is laser focused on deliverables that
matter. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached the design from an object oriented perspective, making use of the UML Diagrams to properly express the requirements. For future projects, 
I would like to continue using the Agile methodologies for flexability, and specfic design patterns to help solve recurring problems efficiently.
